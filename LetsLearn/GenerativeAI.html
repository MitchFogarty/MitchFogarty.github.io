                <h1>Let's Learn: Generative AI</h1>
                <p>In this article we'll dive into the fundamentals of Generative AI and how it all works. We'll look at Large Language Models (LLMs) as a whole and how they are built off training data to produce responses to user queries.</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Generative AI is a tool that can produce a vast amount of results. From text creation, to picture generation, music composition and animation... just to name a few, with more advances everyday who knows what the future of Generative Ai has in store for us!</p>
                <p>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence. It creates content based on its understanding of patterns and relationships in the data it has been trained on. Content produced by Generative AI resembles human-created work, allowing for a range of useful applications.</p>
                <p>A well known example Generative AI is ChaptGPT. Generative Ai is the core technology behind ChatGPT and is what makes it exceptional at creating text-based responses to user input. These text-based responses engage users in a human-like conversation. ChaptGPT now features image generation in co-operation with Dall-E too.</p>
